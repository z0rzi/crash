# Crash

This repo is a set of crash courses, explorations, or anything that has to do
with learning something new. It might have something to do with programming,
but it might not (drawing, cooking, anything really, **as long as I learn
something new**)  

I'll create a new folder for each new course I follow, with the date on it!
