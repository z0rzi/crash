I splitted this in 2 parts, the 1st part is just a dumb copy and paste of a youtube video

After that, I understood that I'd need some better understanding of the language, so I dived into the nim dock, and wrote the 2nd part, which is a cheat sheet of the Nim language.


## Synthesis

Nim is a cool language. But! it's too low level for my liking, I don't think I'll have any real use for it. I'll there for stop my nim learning right here right now.
