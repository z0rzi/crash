# Nimble

This is the first crash course I'm following, many more to come (hopefully)

This week, I'm looking into the Nimble programming Language

That's a web page random quote generator!

## Install

```bash
nimble install karax
nim c karax/tools/karun
karun app.nim

php -S localhost:8000
```

Karax is the static website generator I use in this project. It seems like Pine is a good alternative, to look into.
